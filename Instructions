To run the two services, just go to the root and run:
sudo docker-compose up
And to stop and remove the containers:
sudo docker-compose down
This will raise containers for the two services, RabbitMQ, Jaeger
and OTLP (This two are still work in progress)
Rabbit MQ url:
http://localhost:15672
Jaeger UI url:
http://localhost:16686/search

The services will only work from the docker-compose. To try to run them directly will give an error as some properties need to be set before
